The folder consists of python files and saved models for our proposed adaptive calibrated beam training schemes.
Note:
1. Environment: Pytorch, Python 2.7.
2. Run train_beam_basic.py to start simulations.
3. The folders Basic and Enhanced correspond to the basic scheme and the enhanced scheme, respectively.
4. When evaluating the performance of the adaptive CBT schemes, the trained wide beam number K in model_3Dcov_basic.py should be set to be consistent with the applied model.
5. The detailed code comments can be seen in the folder basic_model.
