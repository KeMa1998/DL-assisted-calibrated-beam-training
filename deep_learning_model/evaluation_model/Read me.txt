The folder consists of python files for performance evaluations.
Note:
1. Environment: Pytorch, Python 2.7.
2. The evaluation of baseline 2 varies from other schemes, since baseline 2 has measured partial narrow beams.
3. When evaluating the performance of the adaptive CBT schemes, the trained wide beam number K in model_3Dcov_basic.py should be set to be consistent with the applied model.
4. The detailed code comments can be seen in the folder basic_model.
